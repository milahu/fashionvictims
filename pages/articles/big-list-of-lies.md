## The Big List of Lies by our Leaders

https://fabiusmaximus.com/2015/08/02/big-list-government-lies-87863/

The history of American since WWII is one of lies by leaders that we eagerly embrace. No matter how often they lie, we believe. Here are some of the most outrageous, some of the most influential, and some that are just routine.

There was no missile gap.
There was no bomber gap.
The Tonkin Gulf incident was fiction.
9-11 was not staged from Afghanistan.
Saddam was not working with al Qaeda.
Iraq’s soldiers didn’t kill babies in Kuwait.
Torture didn’t help us find & kill bin Laden.
Hitler didn’t plan to conquer South America.
The Russians shot down our U-2 over Russia.
The policeman didn’t warn 12-year old Tamir Rice before killing him.
US intel had little evidence proving Saddam had functional WMDs.
The 1976 “Team B” reports about the aggressive powerful USSR were fiction.
There were no Libyan hit teams roaming America (gated TIME article; open version)
Iran has been 3 years from having an atomic bomb since 1984 (& still doesn’t have it).
The USS Vincennes did shoot down Iran Air Flight 655 (we eventually admitted it, then lied about the circumstances). More details here.
Yemen’s al Qaeda in the Ara­bian Penin­sula (AQAP) does not “pose the great­est poten­tial threat to the United States.”
It’s false to say about ISIS in Syria and Iraq that “We are now facing an existential threat to the security of the United States of America …”
