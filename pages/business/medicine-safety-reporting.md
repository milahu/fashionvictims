## The Roche Medicine Safety Scandal

<https://health.alot.com/wellness/10-pharmaceutical-scandals--17219>

In 2012, the pharmaceutical company Roche was under investigation for deficiencies in their medicine safety reporting system. After 15,000 deaths were reported as possibly linked to medications marketed by the pharmaceutical company, investigations were conducted to evaluate if the medications should be reported for adverse reactions.

Though the deaths could not be explicitly linked to the use of Roche medications, the company is facing the consequences for their lack of attention, including reworking their comprehensive action plan for reports such as these.
