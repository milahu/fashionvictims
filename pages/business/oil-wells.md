EMPIRE OF DECEPTION tells the story of Leo Koretz who defrauded people out of millions of dollars by getting them to invest in nonexistent oil wells. The book also discusses other scammers, and how the economic boom of the 1920s created the perfect environment for fraud. People had money to spend, and tricksters of all calibers rose to the occasion. EMPIRE OF DECEPTION describes some incredible scams but also gives an understanding of the circumstances (and people) who were taken in by them. It’s an interesting read, reminding us that no matter what, we’re never safe from being scammed.
