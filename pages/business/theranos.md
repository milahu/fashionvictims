The book was written by research journalist John Carreyrou. It is about the rise and fall of the well-known Theranos company. For ten years, the company managed to maintain the myth of its advanced medical technologies and attract investors. Elizabeth Holmes was able to secure approximately $400 million in investment. Already in 2015, the cost of Theranos was estimated to be $9 billion. At the same time, Holmes owned more than half of the company. Theranos found itself at the centre of public attention in the fall of 2015. It occurred following the publication of many news concerning Theranos analyses. They not only did not use new technologies but also made errors when using standard analysis tools. The book quickly became a best-seller.
