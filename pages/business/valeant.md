## Valeant Scandal

<https://health.alot.com/wellness/10-pharmaceutical-scandals--17219>

Valeant wound up being everything that people hate about businesses in today's society. CEO Micheal Pearson was shady at best. Under Pearson's guidance, Valeant became the pioneer for drug gouging back in 2015, with several of the companies drug prices rising between 200% and 300% within two years. The company became a serial acquirer, buying up and investing in drug researchers with over a hundred transactions between 2008 and 2015.

Once they had their researchers, they used opaque accounting to make it difficult for investors to see how they were doing. Not to mention them merging with a Canadian firm for a lower tax rate and keeping intellectual property stored in tax havens like Luxembourg. All-in-all, Valeant was and still is super sketchy.
