Entire books have been written about how pervasive arsenic was in 19th century Britain. People of the 19th century took in a lot of arsenic on a daily basis without even meaning to, because it was so popular. (A hair analysis of Napoleon suggests he was chock-full of it for most of his life.) But if accidental exposure weren’t enough, doctors were prescribing it for everything from malaria to asthma to cancer.

We all know arsenic is highly toxic, but people back in the day thought it could cure a myriad of conditions including fevers, headaches, diabetes, and blood diseases. Most notably, it was used in Fowler’s Solution, a supposed cure for malaria and syphilis from the 18th century until the 1950s.
