There is evidence that people have used mercury as early as 1500 BC. The shiny, silvery liquid has fascinated humans for thousands of years and was thought to be a miracle cure for literally anything and everything.

From scrapes on your knee to digestive health problems to syphilis, the go-to cure was mercury. Today, we know that mercury is extremely toxic, basically poisoning anyone who ingests it—but for some reason, the deadliness of this substance this didn’t deter ancient doctors.

This chemical element can cause chest pains, heart and lung problems, coughing, tremors, violent muscle spasms – the list goes on and on. It was also used as a “cure” for syphilis and only worked because it killed the patient.
