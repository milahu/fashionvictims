The Ancient Greeks believed that a woman’s womb could wander because it was a separate creature. Plato and Hippocrates described a woman’s uterus as a “living animal.” If it dislodged, a woman had to be fumigated with sulfur. It was thought that it would force the womb back into the correct place. Breathing in sulfur can be pretty toxic.
