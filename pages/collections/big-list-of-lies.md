# The Big List of Lies

## The Big List of Lies by our Leaders by Larry Kummer

<https://fabiusmaximus.com/2015/08/02/big-list-government-lies-87863/>

Post it everywhere to change America.

Summary: Here's the big list of lies by our leaders. It's one of the most important posts among the 3,300 on the FM website. It should be posted in every home. America will change when enough Americans no longer accept leaders who lie --- even those of their own party. This goes up as a reference page on the right-side menu, to be updated with future lies by our leaders. In the comments post other big lies by our leaders that should go on this list.

### (1)  Examples of lies to guide us

> "I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy."
> --- George Washington in his [Farewell Address](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washing.asp "Yale") (1796).

The history of American since WWII is one of lies by leaders that we eagerly embrace. No matter how often they lie, we believe. Here are some of the most outrageous, some of the most influential, and some that are just routine.

- There was no [missile gap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_gap "Wikipedia").
- There was no [bomber gap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber_gap "Wikipedia").

- The [Russians shot down our U-2 over Russia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_U-2_incident "Wikipedia").
- The policeman [didn't warn 12-year old Tamir Rice before killing him](http://fabiusmaximus.com/2015/01/10/race-crime-tamir-rice-police-76082/ "FM").
- [US intel had little evidence proving Saddam had functional WMDs](https://news.vice.com/article/the-cia-just-declassified-the-document-that-supposedly-justified-the-iraq-invasion "Vice").
- The 1976 "[Team B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_B)" reports about the aggressive powerful USSR were fiction.

- [Iran has been 3 years from having an atomic bomb](http://fabiusmaximus.com/2010/01/20/iran-19/ "FM") since 1984 (& still doesn't have it).

- It's false to say about ISIS in Syria and Iraq that "[We are now facing an existential threat to the security of the United States of America](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/06/13/mccain_america_facing_an_existential_threat_in_iraq.html "Real Clear Politics") ..."

### (2)  FDR's campaign against Germany before Pearl Harbor

> "I have in my possession a secret map, made in Germany"
> --- Speech by FDR about NAZI plans to conqueror the western hemisphere.

This is not a lie by US government officials, but still an amazing story: the [British Security Coordination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Security_Coordination) project set up to run information operations in the US to push us into WWII. See this description of the BSC in *[The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/19/military.secondworldwar)*. Their greatest success was the fake map showing Hitler's plans to invade the western hemisphere, a keynote of [FDR's powerful speech on 27 October 1941](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=16030) (see [this story in *The Daily Mail*](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2673298/Hitlers-amazing-map-turned-America-against-Nazis-A-leading-novelists-brilliant-account-British-spies-US-staged-coup-helped-drag-Roosevelt-war.html). For the full story see [*British Security Coordination: The Secret History of British Intelligence in the Americas, 1940-1945*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/088064236X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=088064236X&linkCode=as2&tag=thefabimaxiwe-20&linkId=2JLHEO35CPARSAOV "Amazon").

### (3)  Fear-mongering to start the Cold War

> "Mr. President, if that's what you want there is only one way to get it. That is to make a personal appearance before Congress and scare the hell out of the country."
>
> --- Senator Arthur Vandenberg's advice to Truman about how to start the Cold War. On 12 March 1947 Truman did exactly that. From [Put yourself in Marshall's place](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007E97PI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0007E97PI&linkCode=as2&tag=thefabimaxiwe-20&linkId=5QT5MYQMEHX46G2N "Amazon") by James P. Warburg (1948). In 1941 he helped develop our wartime propaganda programs.

The Soviet Union was a great power, looking for opportunities to expand after WWII. But the US government created the Cold War by exaggerating its menace and power, and lied routinely to keep it going.

What's sad is that they're running the same playbook again, and we're buying it. Government officials demonize Russia while ignoring our role in creating the Ukraine civil war: [Finding truth amidst the lies about Russia & the Ukrainian civil war.](http://fabiusmaximus.com/2015/06/26/news-ukraine-civil-war-russia-alexander-kolomiets-86540/)

### (4)  All our foes are Hitler

> "Every nation has the government it deserves."
> --- Joseph de Maistre (lawyer, diplomat, philosopher), letter dated 13 August 1811 from *Lettres et Opuscules*.

Just as every geopolitical crisis is Munich 1938 to our hawks, all our foes are Hitler. Here are some claims by our Presidents. There's a larger body from US officials, and an almost endless list of often-daft such claims by our geopolitical "experts" and other Very Serious People.

Saddam Hussein was not like Hitler, despite both [Bush Sr.](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-11-28/news/1990332087_1_saddam-hussein-worse-than-hitler-mussolini-and-hitler) and [Bush Jr.](http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/21/1037697805270.html) making the comparison. [Slobodan Milosevic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87) of Serbia was not Hitler, despite [Bill Clinton making the comparison](http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=42001). Vladimir Putin is not Hitler, despite [Hillary Clinton making the comparison of Russia with NAZI Germany](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/03/05/hillary-clinton-says-putins-action-are-like-what-hitler-did-back-in-the-30s/) (as [did British PM David Cameron](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/03/david-cameron-cynicism-comparing-vladimir-putin-adolf-hitler-ukraine)).

See more examples [in an excerpt](http://www.alternet.org/story/23735/%27this_guy_is_a_modern-day_hitler%27) from [*War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00118SUHU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00118SUHU&linkCode=as2&tag=thefabimaxiwe-20&linkId=3BL6MOMF2PUWT6PZ "Amazon") by Norman Solomon (2005), and in "[61 Times Bill Kristol Was Reminded of Hitler and Churchill](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/04/61-times-kristol-reminded-of-hitler-churchill.html "NY Magazine")".

### (5) Other examples of lies to guide us

> "An honest man's word is as good as his bond."
> --- Said by the squire Sancho Panza in Miguel de Cervantes [*Don Quixote*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060934344/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0060934344&linkCode=as2&tag=thefabimaxiwe-20&linkId=AWCUJPAJ367XKBLD "Amazon") (1605).

Keeping us scared by false alarms about terrorism in America: [The US government is competent, as proven by the results of the latest terror alert](http://fabiusmaximus.com/2013/08/12/nsa-terror-alert-53710/), [Should we panic at the many warnings about domestic terrorism?](http://fabiusmaximus.com/2015/04/10/domestic-terrorism-islam-rightwing-warnings-82436/), [Are ISIS terrorists coming to America from a base in Mexico?](http://fabiusmaximus.com/2015/04/20/judicial-watch-isis-terrorists-coming-from-mexico-83175/), [Who believes that the Federal government seeks to take over Texas?](http://fabiusmaximus.com/2015/05/14/poll-of-believes-that-jade-helm-invading-texas-84386/), and [Prepare for terror on the 4th of July!](http://fabiusmaximus.com/2015/07/02/isis-terrorism-warning-4th-july-86868/)

### (6) Are we cowards, or just unusually gullible?

> "Cowardice, alone of all the vices, is purely painful --- horrible to anticipate, horrible to feel, horrible to remember; Hatred has its pleasures. It is therefore often the compensation by which a frightened man reimburses himself for the miseries of Fear. The more he fears, the more he will hate. And Hatred is also a great anodyne for shame."

> --- From the demon Screwtape, in [The Screwtape Letters](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060652934/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0060652934&linkCode=as2&tag=thefabimaxiwe-20&linkId=DJNPA3YIM4XHNMN3 "Amazon") by C.S. Lewis.

See the common element to these lies: they arouse our fear. Why does fear have such an effect on us, despite officials 'long history of lying to us about threats? How do you describe people ruled by their fears? We call them cowards. It's the description of us that none of us dare say.

- [Are Americans easily panicked cowards? I think not, but many experts disagree.](http://fabiusmaximus.com/2009/04/24/cowards/ "FM")
- [Today's fear-mongering (they think we're cowards, but I'm sure they're wrong).](http://fabiusmaximus.com/2010/05/04/fear/ "FM")
- [Why are we so fearful? Have we become cowards?](http://fabiusmaximus.com/2014/09/16/america-fear-cowardness-isis-71925/ "FM")

Our leaders so frequently employ fear to guide us because lies work. The information superhighway has not made us smarter, it just carries the lies faster and father. Our leaders will stop when we become stronger and more skeptical. On that day we will have taken a large step towards retaking control of America.

    Great post, but only scratches the surface of the Big Lies we get told by our pols, our church leaders, our scientists, our teachers, our business managers, and our experts.

    Other Big Lies include: "Capitalism is the only viable economic system." (Reality check: most of American society does not operate by capitalism, including our libraries and universities, our K-12 schools, our fire departments, our police, our emergency first responders, and our military. )

    "Our best and brightest intellectuals come from the Ivy League universities." (Reality check: the people responsible for America's worst blunders, from Viet Nam to Iraq 2003 to the global financial meltdown, boasted a unique panoply of advanced degrees from elite Ivy League colleges. Read David Halberstam's book ["The Best and the Brightest."](http://www.amazon.com/The-Best-Brightest-David-Halberstam/dp/0449908704))

    "Scientists are objective and unswayed by social groupthink or mass hysteria or cultural fads." (Reality check: 40 years ago, scientists were warning about global cooling. 80 years ago, scientists were pushing quackery like eugenics and urging politicians to enact laws to sterilize poor people. Read the book *Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Charles McKay.)*

     *"Mathematics applied to the social sciences is useful and effective." (Reality check: see the paper ["The Mythology of Game Theory"](http://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/237/docs/McTurnLer_Mythology.pdf) or the book ["When Genius Failed."](http://www.amazon.com/When-Genius-Failed-Long-Term-Management/dp/0375758259))

    "Economics is a science (rather than a smokescreen for justifying the predations of a corrupt elite)." (Reality check: peruse John Quiggin's book ["Zombie Economics: How Dead Ideas Still Walk among Us.")](http://www.amazon.com/Zombie-Economics-Ideas-Still-among/dp/0691154546/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1438629570&sr=1-1&keywords=zombie+economics)

    "America has the greatest military in history." (Reality check: America hasn't won a major war since 1945\. See the article ["A Record of Unparalleled Failure,"](http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175854/tomgram%3A_engelhardt,_a_record_of_unparalleled_failure/) Tomdispatch, 10 June 2014.)

    "The American people are the greatest people in the world." (Reality check: read the Esquire article ["Greetings From Idiot America,"](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a395/esq0207greetings/) or almost anything by H. L. Mencken or Mark Twain or the journalism of Tom Wolfe.)*

    *"America raised itself by its own bootstraps with a combination of Protestant work ethic, yankee ingenuity, and American exceptionalism." (Reality check: read Howard Zinn's ["A People's History of the United States."](http://www.amazon.com/A-Peoples-History-United-States/dp/0060838655))*

    <section class="ast-comment-content comment" style="box-sizing: inherit; display: block; clear: both;">

    Thank for your effort at trying to turn things around! Cowardice and gullibility go together. Both are largely the result of an atomized society. If people stand together both can be overcome. Bertrand Russell pointed out that the upper class (like himself) learned courage and solidarity at institutions such as Eton. The 30s founders of the labor movement learned both in battling with company goons and management.
    Gullibility can be overcome by people talking together at blogs like this one, but better face to face.

    Finally, years ago during the Vietnam War people would have been shocked that THEIR government lied to them. (Maybe this helped fuel the protests.) Today you get a cynical shrug (as seen apparently in the number of comments).

        Social Bill,

        That's a brilliant insight! I have written often about [our alienation from our society](http://fabiusmaximus.com/tag/alienation/), our atomization --- but I never connected those things to our gullibility, fear, and grasping at tribal-like identities.
