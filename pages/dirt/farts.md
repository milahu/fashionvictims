# Farts

## Fart Jars

During the Great Plague of London in 1665-1666, people weren’t sure what was causing the sickness. They thought it was something powerful in the air. (It wasn’t; it was rats.) To combat the miasma in the air, they suggested that people keep air on hand that was equally potent, but safe.

This meant that a city full of people started storing their farts in jars, and occasionally opening them to breathe them in, hoping to keep the Plague at bay.
