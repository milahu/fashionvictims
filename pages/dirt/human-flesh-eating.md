Do you have a headache, muscle cramps, or stomach ulcers? Apparently, doctors in the 12th century thought you could fix these issues by eating parts of a person. The Romans believed that the blood of fallen gladiators could cure epilepsy, and Egyptians made “mummy powder” using ground up bodies. In the 17th century, King Charles II was known for enjoying “King’s Drops,” which were made from a crumbled human skull. Not only is it morally wrong but consuming a person who died of a disease or illness could also kill the consumer.
