## Moldy Bread

James Allen, curator of Egyptian art at the Met, translated a 4,000-year-old papyrus that, among other things, recommends putting moldy bread on wounds. As gross and weird as that may sound, Allen rightly points out that “They didn’t know what bacteria was, but they were already fighting infections.” It may sound unappealing, but it was centuries ahead of its time.

## Ergoapiol

Ergoapiol is a mouthful and not that creative if you get down to it. It’s a combination of ergot and apiol and was sold during the early 1900s to treat menstrual irregularities. Well, it turns out that ergot is pretty toxic. It’s capable of reducing blood flow so much that gangrene takes hold. It can also cause some pretty insane hallucinations. Apiol is also pretty bad and can damage the liver and kidneys.
