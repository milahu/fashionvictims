If you’re an ancient Egyptian with a toothache, what do you do? If you said “smash up a dead mouse and put it on the pain,” well…you’re right, but why on earth would you guess that? Mice also had a reputation for painkillers in Elizabethan England, where they also treated whooping cough, smallpox, and more. That may have had more to do with how many mice they had than it did anything else.

Would you put a dead mouse in your mouth? Ancient Egyptians didn’t think twice about this gag-worthy cure. It was thought that mashing a mouse, blending it with other ingredients, and applying it to a painful tooth would cure a toothache. Elizabethan England also used dead mice as a cure. They would cut a mouse in half and apply it to a wart. Today, we know mice carry all sorts of diseases.
