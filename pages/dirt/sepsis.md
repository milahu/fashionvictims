## Powder of Sympathy

Sir Kenelm Digby’s “Powder of Sympathy” was used for a specific purpose: rapier wounds. It was made from earthworms, pig brains, rust, and bits of mummified corpses. The best thing about this cure is that you didn’t even put it on the wound – you put it on the sword blade itself. Either way, your injury won’t get better, or patients wouldn't get sepsis or bleed out.
