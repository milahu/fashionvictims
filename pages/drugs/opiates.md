## Rochester Drug Cooperatives Opioid Scandal

<https://health.alot.com/wellness/10-pharmaceutical-scandals--17219>

The American populace faces an opioid epidemic on a massive scale. Every day, 91 Americans die from an opioid overdose. The crisis began in the late 1990s and early 2000s when doctors began prescribing a lot of opioid painkillers which began the widespread misuse and addiction. From then on, it's become more and more of a problem. With this epidemic claiming tens of thousands of lives a year, the government is trying to hold both sides of the issue (manufacturers and distributors) more accountable.

After a two year investigation, Rochester Drug Cooperatives became the first major drug distributor to be charged for its role in perpetuating this deadly epidemic. The charges against Rochester included conspiring to distribute drugs and defrauding the federal government (after the company didn't report thousands of suspicious opioid orders).

## Soothing Syrup

During the 19th century, instead of paying attention to their children, stressed parents would give them “soothing syrups” that would make Lil Wayne jealous. The syrups were full of morphine, sulfate, chloroform, codeine, heroin, opium, and cannabis.

It is estimated that each ounce of Mrs. Winslow’s Soothing Syrup contained 65 milligrams of pure morphine. As a result of these dangerous concoctions, many toddlers died during this time after their parents attempted to self-medicate them for misbehaving.

Most of the ingredients in Mrs. Winslow’s Soothing Syrup are fine…except for the 6mg of morphine per fluid ounce. While it depends on the person, it can take as little as 200mg for an adult to die of morphine overdose. The big issue here is that it was used on children. Many kids took a permanent sleep after Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup. It was so bad that it was called a “baby killer” in 1911.
