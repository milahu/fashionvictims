From Pesticides to Packaging, How Chemicals Have Contaminated the Food Chain and Are Making Us Sick

The past thirty years have seen a dramatic increase in cancer rates, neurodegenerative and reproductive disorders, and diabetes, particularly in developed countries. Since the end of World War II, approximately one hundred thousand synthetic chemical molecules have invaded our environment—and our food chain. In Our Daily Poison, award–winning journalist and documentary filmmaker Marie–Monique Robin investigates the links between these two trends, revealing how a toxic mix of corporate interests and public ignorance about invisible poisons may be costing us our lives.

The result of a rigorous two–year–long investigation that took Robin across three continents, Our Daily Poison documents the shocking array of chemicals in our every–day lives and their effects on our bodies over time. Moving beyond the substances, Robin also dissects the byzantine, entirely inadequate evaluation and approval systems for chemical products, highlighting the fallacy of the “acceptable daily intake” and other regulatory standards for harmful substances.

Our Daily Poison also exposes the chemical industry’s lobbying efforts to keep highly toxic products on the market. Drawing on scientific studies, the testimony of international regulatory agencies, and a range of in–depth interviews—from farm workers suffering from acute chronic poisoning to FDA and WHO representatives and to the scientists who develop these compounds—Robin makes a gripping and compelling case for outrage and action.
