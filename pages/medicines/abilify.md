## The Bristol-Myers Squibb Abilify Scandal

<https://health.alot.com/wellness/10-pharmaceutical-scandals--17219>

Abilify is an antipsychotic medication marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb. In 2007, BMS had to pay over $515 million in fines because it was discovered that Abilify had been marketed for conditions that it had not actually been approved to treat.

Even worse, the company had sales teams marketing the medication to nursing homes, even though they knew the drug had potentially fatal side effects for the elderly who suffer from dementia.
