## Questcor Pharmaceutical Price Hike Scandal

<https://health.alot.com/wellness/10-pharmaceutical-scandals--17219>

In early 2019, two whistleblowers revealed that Questcor Pharmaceuticals was responsible for one of the largest drug price increases in U.S. history. Questcor bribed doctors and their staff to increase sales as part of a "multi-tiered strategy" to boost sales of the H.P. Acthar Gel (best known for treating a rare infant seizure disorder).

In 2000, the price of the gel was $40 a vial, but now, in 2019, it costs nearly $39,000, creating an increase of almost 97,000%. The price increase, combined with the aggressive sales push, has upped the drug's annual sales to over $1 billion. The sales of the drug have also robbed the government of a few billion dollars, Medicare spending and reimbursement on Acthar has increased to almost $2 billion over the past six years. The Justice Department has intervened in the whistleblowers' lawsuit and filed one of their own.
