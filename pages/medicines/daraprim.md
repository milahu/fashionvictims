## Martin Shkreli's Daraprim Scandal

<https://health.alot.com/wellness/10-pharmaceutical-scandals--17219>

You've probably already heard of the infamous 'pharma bro' Martin Shkreli, and for good reason. The public was outraged when the cost of Daraprim hiked from $13.50 to an eye-bulging $750 per tablet. This 5,000% increase received massive public backlash and ridicule. Daraprim is used to treat toxoplasmosis (a parasitic infection that mostly affects those with HIV, malaria, and cancer).

Thanks to the insane price hike, the average cost of treatment spiked from $1,130 to $63,000. Facing public outrage, Shkreli hired lobbyists to help him deal with the fallout. The price did wind up being decreased from $750 per tablet to $375, which is still a 2,500% increase.
