## Mylan's EpiPen Scandal

<https://health.alot.com/wellness/10-pharmaceutical-scandals--17219>

The EpiPen has long-since been the method of choice for combating life-threatening allergic reaction and, for better or worse, Mylan knew just how vital their medicine was. So what do they do with it? Jacked up the prices to exorbitant amounts. Despite the fact that it only takes $1 to manufacture the EpiPen two-pack, Mylan (who bought the rights to EpiPen in 2009), jacked up the prices from $100 to $600 in 2016.

And consumers can't do anything about it, EpiPen dominates the epinephrine auto-injector market just like Kleenex does with the tissue market. Consumers are just left stuck with only EpiPen to choose from or run the risk of death. At least, until 2018, when the FDA approved the first generic competitor to EpiPen.
