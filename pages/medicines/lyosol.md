## Lysol For Hygiene and Birth Control

You may be familiar with Lysol, a powerfully corrosive cleaning product that’s covered in warnings not to touch it with your bare skin. But in the 1930s, it was touching plenty of bare skin, and then some.

Lysol was originally marketed as a feminine hygiene douche – “feminine hygiene” being lightly coded for “birth control,” which was illegal at the time. Of course, Lysol failed miserably at being a feminine cleanser and as a birth control, but that didn’t stop Lysol from telling women it was gentle, and that it was totally safe to just squirt a ton of it inside themselves.
