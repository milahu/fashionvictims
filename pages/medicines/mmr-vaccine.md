In recent years, Merck has been in the firing line once again for fraudulently representing the mumps component of its MMR vaccine. It is alleged that the company falsified reports that state the current MMR vaccine is more effective than the original MMR vaccine.

There are many whistleblowers, who were employees for Merck, claim to have witnessed firsthand reports being falsified and evidence being destroyed in order to cover it up.
