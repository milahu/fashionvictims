Oxycodone is used to treat moderate to severe pain, but it is considered to be a high-risk habit-forming drug. It can cause respiratory problems or death when combined with other substances or alcohol.

In addition to its addictive properties, can still be dangerous. Accidental overdose can also occur for a number of reasons--including if patients take doses to close to one another.
