In 2004, pharmaceutical company Merck abruptly announced a recall of Vioxx, which was a popular pain medication at the time. After the fact, it was discovered by the FDA that Vioxx significantly increased the risk of heart attack and stroke. By the time Vioxx was pulled from the market, nearly 25 million Americans had taken the drug, and it was tied to almost 40,000 deaths.

Many say that Vioxx was the worst drug disaster in history. It's suspected that Merck and the FDA were working together to quiet the health concerns and keep the drug on the market. Fines and class action lawsuits followed, which ended up costing the company more than $5 billion dollars.
