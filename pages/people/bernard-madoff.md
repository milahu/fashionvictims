## “The Wizard of Lies” by Diana B. Henriques

The book by journalist Diana Henriques is about Bernard Madoff, who constructed the world’s largest financial pyramid. In the early 1960s, he established a firm on Wall Street. Over time, a small business venture has grown into one of the largest investment funds in the area.

It earned Bernard Madoff a reputation as a successful and influential financier, broker, financial adviser, and philanthropist over the years. However, it was revealed in 2008 that the fund had grown into the largest financial pyramid in history over the previous decade and a half. The biggest scandal erupted, resulting not only in multibillion-dollar losses but also in the collapse of both Madoff and all those who trusted him.

The court sentenced him to 150 years in prison. The book so impressed the directors that it was adapted into a film of the same name. Furthermore, the journalist who conducted the investigation played herself in the documentary.

As you can see, investigating is a difficult task that not everyone is capable of. You do not have to be a detective if you do not have much time and only need to conduct a small research on a specific subject. You can do that quickly with modern technology by visiting essay review websites, including Best Writers Online, to produce high-quality material.
