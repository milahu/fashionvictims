# Harshad Mehta

## The Scam by Debashis Basu, Sucheta Dalal

The most thrilling non-fiction business book ever written in India. A fast, colourful narrative, knitting together the life and times of all stock market players involved in two of India's biggest stock market scams.

The Scam, a chronicle of two of the most famous scams in the Indian stock markets, is now back in a digital avatar. The story told by Sucheta Dalal and Debashis Basu, can't find a more credible and informed couple of storytellers for these events. First published in April 1993, the book was an immediate bestseller but had been out of print for a while.
This 8th edition of the scam includes the original Harshad Mehta Scam and the Ketan Parekh Scam, while also delving into the JPC Fiasco and the Global Trust Bank Scam. The basic question that the book deals with is, "what really happened in the two great Indian scams?" The answer to this question, detailed in the book, brings up another important one, "Have we learnt anything since, so that such things don't happen again?"

Fascinating!

I find it hard to review just the book, as I’m influenced by the series too, which I’d say is rather more than the book owing to multiple factors.

There were two things that instantly gained my attention, Harshad Mehta and Citibank (for the obvious reasons).

Firstly, the sheer volume of this scam is astounding, let alone the people involved. It is to be noted here that ‘the scam’ does not refer to a single entity’s clever fraudulent activities, but the complete exploitation by the banking sector and brokers of the rot within the system and the regulator’s blind eye to the same.

Harshad Shantilal Mehta, our ‘Big Bull’ is therefore not the only one to be blamed for the mess. I can understand why people looked up (and continue to) to him. His rags-to-riches story is unique on many counts. Harshad entered the market as a nobody. He’d done some random business before and was unsatisfied and restless about the finances of his family. But his passion for the markets, right from when he joined as a jobber at the BSE is clear, it’s even contagious to read/watch that I’d bet people have already started or are thinking about trading after watching the series.

Harshad’s character is intriguing, his ambitions, brashness about the way he handled situations, convincing oratories, risk exposure (“Risk hai toh ishq hai”), taking on the big players, eternal optimism and above all the whole bragging about his successes (which eventually brought him down).

Citibank’s activities were shocking to read. In fact, it was pathetic that most of the local banks didn’t know about the Bond tables. Any simple understanding of the bond prices and yield would’ve told us that Citibank’s deals were outright rip-offs. All its activities with the brokers, making money from the stock market and sharing the profits, while dumping the losses in clients’ PMS accounts were crooked. No surprise that Harshad adapted its own methods and trumped it when even the Bear Cartel was dry on funds.

As a common man, it was shocking to read how much was happening in the banking system without anyone suspecting anything and the regulators turning blind eye. Could understand the evils of over-regulation, how it creates an arbitrage when not done evenly.

The Bulls, Bear Cartel, Banks-Brokers nexus, BRs, diverting banking funds to push the markets, insider trading, PMS, RBI functioning, politics and CBI, it was an interesting read.
