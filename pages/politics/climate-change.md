Why the Green New Deal Is the Wrong Solution to the Wrong Problem

A must read, particularly if you happen to be a reasonable person who is on the fence about climate change. Marc explains the climate initiative has nothing to do with saving the environment and everything to do with redistribution of wealth, socialism.

"Green Fraud" points out, using the words of various UN officials, leaders of the green movement or the architects of the "Green New Deal", that the plans to save the world by destroying modern industrial society have nothing to do with the environment and everything to do with reordering the world along Marxist lines. That same Marxism that caused in excess of 100 million deaths in the 20th century.

The leaders of the green movement are the modern Bolsheviks; profoundly ignorant, utterly without conscience or morality and obsessed with saving mankind no matter how many people have to die in the process. Just the usual sociopaths like all of the Marxist leaders in the 20th century.

It's a labor reading books like this though it's well researched and written; one has to wade thru ignorance and stupidity of the the environmental activists as the author makes his points.
