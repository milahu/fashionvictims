## Scam: How the Black Leadership Exploits Black America by Jesse Lee Peterson

<https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/141590.Scam>

In this provocative book, Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, the most outspoken critic of the civil-rights establishment in America today, lays bare its corrupt leadership, courageously taking aim at the bigest names―Jesse Jackson, Louis Farrakhan, Al Sharpton, Maxine Waters, among others―claiming they are nothing more than scam artists profiting off the hatred and disorder they foster in the black community. Peterson insists it's time to throw off the oppression of the established black leadership and stand for the American ideals of freedom, personal responsibility, free enterprise, and moral principle.
