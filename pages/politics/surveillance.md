## The Edward Snowden Affair by Michael Gurnow

<https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18767191-the-edward-snowden-affair>

Exposing the Politics and Media Behind the NSA Scandal

The narrative begins with Snowden literally growing up in the shadow of the National Security Agency. At a pace that reads like a taut political thriller Gurnow reveals for the first time the dramatic details of how select members of the media broke the story, and the cat and mouse game that followed between the media and the administration. Gurnow goes on to explain in plain language the political, legal and technological implications of the whistleblower's classified data.

## No Place to Hide by Glenn Greenwald

Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State

By Glenn Greenwald, star of Citizenfour, the Academy Award-winning documentary on Edward Snowden

In May 2013, Glenn Greenwald set out for Hong Kong to meet an anonymous source who claimed to have astonishing evidence of pervasive government spying and insisted on communicating only through heavily encrypted channels. That source turned out to be the twenty-nine-year-old NSA contractor Edward Snowden, and his revelations about the agency's widespread, systemic overreach proved to be some of the most explosive and consequential news in recent history, triggering a fierce debate over national security and information privacy.

Now Greenwald fits all the pieces together, recounting his high-intensity eleven-day trip to Hong Kong, examining the broader implications of the surveillance detailed in his reporting for The Guardian, and revealing fresh information on the NSA's unprecedented abuse of power with documents from the Snowden archive. Fearless and incisive, No Place to Hide has already sparked outrage around the globe and been hailed by voices across the political spectrum as an essential contribution to our understanding of the U.S. surveillance state.
