Before anesthesia was invented, doctors had to figure out a way to knock out their patients. They invented something called “dwale,” which was a mixture of lettuce, vinegar, hemlock, opium, henbane, bryony root, and bile. Hemlock, bryony root, and henbane are all very toxic, so patients would die whenever it wasn't mixed correctly.
