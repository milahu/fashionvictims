Bladder stones are pretty painful, but most people can pass them without much treatment. During the Middle Ages, bladder stones were treated very seriously. A healer called a “lithotomists” traveled across Europe and would remove the deposit through the groin. Apparently, patients would frequently bleed to death during the procedure. If they survived, the patient obviously wouldn’t receive antibiotics.
