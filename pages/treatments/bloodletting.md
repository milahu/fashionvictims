Bloodletting was incredibly popular for a really long time – around 2,000 years. Bloodletting was when a healer or “doctor” would withdraw blood from a patient to cure an illness or disease. While some people benefitted from this procedure, some died. George Washington and Charles II are two of the most famous people who died due to bloodletting.
