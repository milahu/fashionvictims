## Lobotomies

The lobotomy may actually be worse than its predecessor trepanning – and it was developed as recently as 1935. This surgery severed the connection between the prefrontal cortex and the rest of the brain. The problem is that we need the prefrontal cortex.

It’s the part of the brain that helps us with complex planning and personality expression, and more – basically, the things that make us human. The surgery fell out of favor by the 1950s, but only after ruining thousands of lives.

Lobotomies are discussed, but do you know how they’re completed? A doctor stuck a special ice pick, called an orbitoclast, through the top of the eye socket. After breaking through a thin layer of bone, he would twirl the ice pick to cut through fibers in the brain. All this happened in 10 minutes. It could have severe negative side effects and kill the patient if not done correctly. Even if done correctly, a lot of patients still killed themselves.  

## Trepanning

The oldest surgical procedure known to man is called trepanation, which basically involves drilling holes in your skull. Trepanation was most commonly used to treat seizures and migraines—and anesthesia was generally not used during the procedure.

Trepanning is a medical procedure that’s still used today, but only when absolutely necessary. This procedure is when a hole is drilled into the skull to treat health problems like pressure on the brain. While useful, it could easily cause your death if you bled out or if the “surgeon” went a little too deep – something that could very well happen during the Middle Ages.
