Ancient Greek physician Hippocrates whose name gives us the Hippocratic oath that every doctor takes – recommends treating hemorrhoids by heating pieces of iron until they're red-hot, and attacking the hemorrhoid with them until it burns away.

As horrifying as that sounds, we can't just blame Ancient Times folks for being ignorant. "Shoving red-hot pokers into people" was still the go-to treatment in medical texts as recently as 1882. That’s a solid 1400 years of medical treatment that sounds like a threat from the Wu-Tang Clan.

Hemorrhoids suck – no doubt. Still, it’s better to have hemorrhoids now than it was in the 12th century. Medieval manuscripts revealed that surgeons would treat this issue by burning them away with a cautery iron. In most cases, a tube would be inserted so the red-hot iron could move in and out of the body until the hemorrhoids burned loose. We’ll let you imagine how this was deadly.
