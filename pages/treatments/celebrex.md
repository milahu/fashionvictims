Also in 2012, Pfizer came under scrutiny for deceiving the public by falsely representing a study about an arthritis drug called Celebrex. In the study, Pfizer claimed that Celebrex was safer than other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen.  The FDA proceeded to warn Pfizer, along with their co-marketers Pharmacia, that their ads were false and misleading.

The company was then forced to pay over $60 million in charges for bribing government officials to approve and prescribe Pfizer products. Bribed government officials included government doctors, hospital administrators, and members of regulatory and purchasing committees in China, Russia, Italy, Bulgaria, Serbia, Kazakhstan, and Croatia.
