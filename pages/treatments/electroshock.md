Also known at electroshock therapy, this treatment electrically induces seizures in patients in an attempt to relieve the symptoms of various psychiatric disorders. For years, ECT was performed frequently, and often against the will of the patient. It was used to treat a horrifyingly broad spectrum of things, including “homosexuality,” which was considered a disorder by the medical establishment of the day.

Today we still use ECT as a last-resort treatment in cases of severe depression. But we only do so after all else has failed, and only with informed consent and anesthesia. The side effects can be rough, but ECT does save lives.

Today, most treatments for erectile dysfunction involve Viagra or Cialis. But beginning in the 18th century, some people sought to treat ED by blasting their penis with electricity. You could by a special “Heidelberg Electric Belt” just for the purpose! Astonishingly, the technique seems to be making a bit of a comeback.
