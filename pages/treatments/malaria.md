In the late 19th century, Julius Wagner-Jauregg was trying to treat mental illness by inducing fever. He induced fever by…wait for it…giving people malaria on purpose. Obviously, that didn’t work, except in one case – treating syphilis.

Wagner-Jauregg’s work came in vogue, and deliberate malaria infection became the go-to treatment for syphilis from 1917 until the 1940s. Malaria was considered safer since it was easier to treat, but the malaria still killed about 15% of the patients. Wagner-Jauregg won the Nobel prize for his breakthrough.
