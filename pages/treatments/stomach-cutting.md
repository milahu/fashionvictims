# Stomach Cutting

## Bariatric Surgery

Some people refer to bariatric surgery as a “lobotomy of the stomach.” This surgery puts a device around the stomach, but sometimes doctors remove a portion of the stomach. Studies have recently shown that it’s more dangerous than we originally imagined. Around 21% of people had issues during the hospital stay while 40% had complications after 6 months. Studies also show a mortality rate as high as 6% after 5 years.
