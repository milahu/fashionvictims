John R. Brinkley rose to fame and fortune as one of the wealthiest doctors in America – all with a degree he bought from a sham university for $500. How did he do it? By surgically implanting goat testicles into human scrotums as an impotence cure.

As we note elsewhere in this article, you can talk someone into literally anything if you tell them it will help them have erections. Brinkley’s procedures were dangerous, killing several hundred patients with testicular infections. The next time someone complains that modern society makes stupid people famous, point them to Brinkley.

All you had to do was have goat testicles implanted in your scrotum. Many patients died.
