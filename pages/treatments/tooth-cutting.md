“Cutting teeth” isn’t just an expression. In 1575, a French army surgeon named Ambriose Pare began cutting the gums of children with a knife, so that the teeth could come in more easily. He came to this method after drawing some...sloppy conclusions from the autopsy of a dead child. Soon the horrifying procedure spread, and a variety of treatments emerged alongside it until people finally went back to letting nature take its course.
